## Scoring Dimensions (1-10 scale)
- **accuracy** (Issue Identification Accuracy): Are the identified issues real and significant? Are important issues missed? Higher score = fewer false positives and fewer missed real issues.
- **actionability** (Actionability of Suggestions): Are the suggestions specific, concrete, and directly implementable? Higher score = developer can act on feedback immediately.
- **depth** (Depth of Analysis): Does the review demonstrate deep understanding of the code, its context, and potential implications? Higher score = systemic thinking beyond surface-level observations.
- **clarity** (Clarity of Expression): Is the review well-organized, clearly written, and easy to follow? Higher score = logical structure and precise language.

## Instructions
Score each reviewer independently on all 4 dimensions. Be discriminating — use the full 1-10 range. Do not give everyone similar scores.
